# What does Ethics Have to Do with Technology?

There is a growing international consensus that ethics is of increasing importance to education in technical fields, and that it must become part of the language that technologists are comfortable using.

## What is driving this growing focus on technology ethics?

Reason: **Technologies are not ethically ‘neutral’**, for they reflect the values that we ‘bake in’ to them with our design choices.

* Technology increasingly shapes how human beings seek the good life, and with what degree of success.
  * [Well-designed and well-used technologies](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] can make it easier for people to live well
  * [Poorly designed or misused technologies](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] can make it harder to live well

## Why is ethics now such an important topic in technical contexts, more so than ever?

* the unprecedented speeds and scales at which technical advances are transforming the social fabric of our lives
* the inability of regulators and lawmakers to keep up with these changes
* many lawmakers lack the technical expertise needed to guide effective technology policy
* technologies are reshaping the global distribution of power, justice, and responsibility

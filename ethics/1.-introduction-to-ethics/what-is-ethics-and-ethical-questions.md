# What is Ethics and Ethical Questions?

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2anXOF2QkI" %}

## Origins of the Word "Ethics"

The word “ethics” derived from the Greek word **ἠθικός** (ēthikós) which means “relating to one’s character”. The word ēthikós comes from its root **ἦθος** (êthos), meaning “character, moral nature”.

### "Ethics" vs "Morality/Moral"

The word "ethics" is commonly used interchangeably with "morality" or "moral", but they are different:

* “Morals” often describe one’s particular values concerning _what is right and what is wrong_
* Ethics is often associated with a broader societal or professional framework and can vary based on cultural, social, and philosophical considerations

<summary>Case Study: A person finds a wallet containing a large sum of money on the street.</summary>

* From a moral perspective: The person’s decision could be influenced by their personal values. If the person’s moral values prioritize honesty and doing what is right, they may choose to return the wallet.
* From an ethical perspective: The person might consider returning the wallet to its owner or handing it over to the authorities. This action aligns with principles of honesty, responsibility, and social duty.

## Academic Definitions

Ethics is also called moral philosophy, and ethics is a branch of philosophy. So, what is **philosophy**? (This is a philosophical question!)

> * Philosophy is the attempt to understand ourselves and the world. — [Ray Monk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Monk)
> * Philosophy is thinking really hard about the most important questions and trying to bring analytic clarity both to the questions and the answers. — [Marilyn Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_McCord_Adams)&#x20;
> * Philosophy is what philosophers do. — [Robert Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Merrihew_Adams)&#x20;
> * Philosophy is the successful love of thinking. — [John Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Armstrong_\(British_writer/philosopher\))
> * You’ve hit me with this question. — [Catalin Avramescu](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C4%83t%C4%83lin_Avramescu)

{% hint style="info" %}
Philosophy is an academic subject of general and fundamental questions concerning topics like existence, reason, knowledge, values, mind, and language.
{% endhint %}

Within philosophy, ethics considers:

* people’s <mark style="background-color:orange;">values</mark>
* sources of <mark style="background-color:orange;">values</mark>
* whether <mark style="background-color:orange;">values</mark> differ over time and place
* how people and groups translate <mark style="background-color:orange;">values</mark> into behaviors
* ...

We can see that ethics is related to <mark style="background-color:orange;">values</mark>, then what is values?

### Values

Examples of values can include <mark style="background-color:blue;">honesty</mark>, <mark style="background-color:blue;">compassion</mark>, <mark style="background-color:blue;">respect</mark>, <mark style="background-color:blue;">integrity</mark>, <mark style="background-color:blue;">freedom</mark>, <mark style="background-color:blue;">family</mark>, <mark style="background-color:blue;">loyalty</mark>, <mark style="background-color:blue;">social justice</mark>, <mark style="background-color:blue;">environmental stewardship</mark>, etc.

## Ethical Questions

Ethical questions pertain to inquiries and discussions about morality, values, and principles that guide human behavior. These questions often explore what is considered right or wrong, good or bad, and just or unjust in various situations. Ethical questions can arise in a wide range of contexts, including personal dilemmas, professional settings, societal issues, and philosophical inquiries.

Examples of ethical questions include:

* If something at a yard sale is far more valuable than the posted price, do I have to let the seller know?
* Is it considered stealing to take pens from a bank? What about extra napkins from a fast-food restaurant?
* Is it OK to fantasize about someone else when I’m with my partner?&#x20;
* Is it ever OK to sneak a peek at your child’s e-mail?

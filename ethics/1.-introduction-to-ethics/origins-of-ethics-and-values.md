# Origins of Ethics and Values

## Objectivist & Relativist

**Do humans have an innate capacity to consider questions of right and wrong?** What philosophers think?

* **Objectivist**: it is possible to identify and enact the solutions to ethical problems using reasoning and ethics tools.
* **Relativist**: not everyone sees a moral problem in the same way.

{% hint style="info" %}
Objectivists think there is one objectively existed right or wrong position, but relativists don’t think so.

### Relativist

The following list introduces some representative relativists:

* <mark style="background-color:green;">Cultural Relativism</mark> [**Ruth Benedict**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Benedict): Cultures should be understood in their own context rather than judged by the standards of another culture.&#x20;
* <mark style="background-color:green;">Moral Relativism</mark> [Richard Rorty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rorty): Moral concepts and values are products of human culture and discourse rather than objective truths.
* <mark style="background-color:green;">Religious Relativism</mark> [John Hick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hick): He argued that different religions are valid ways of approaching the ultimate reality, and no single religion holds an absolute monopoly on truth.
* <mark style="background-color:green;">Linguistic Relativism</mark> [Benjamin Lee Whorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Lee_Whorf): The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis suggests that language shapes thought and perception, and different languages can lead to different ways of understanding the world.&#x20;
* <mark style="background-color:green;">Aesthetic Relativism</mark> [Andy Warhol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol): Art is what you can get away with.
* <mark style="background-color:green;">Historical Relativism</mark> [Michel Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault): He believed that historical accounts are influenced by the prevailing cultural and social contexts.

Some relativists believe that our perception of ethical behavior depends on social conventions, which vary from society to society.

### Vaguely Defined Boundary

Ultimately, the distinction between relativism and objectivism is a philosophical debate that has been ongoing for centuries. The boundary between them can indeed be somewhat vague and subject to interpretation. Just like ethics in other fields, cybersecurity ethics have been considered with both relativism and objectivism. However, the ethics in many fields cannot be clearly divided into objectivism or relativism.
